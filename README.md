Sunday Game Dev #3
==================

Me and some friends decided to get together on random sunday afternoons and try to code something we never coded before (basically, games). 

This is the third of such sundays and we tried to replicate the original simcity game. 

We started late, so we only had 4 hours to code. I managed to get reasonable procedural map generation and basic building features. Stopped working when beggining the fun part: the simulation code.

Next free sunday I'll finish this mofo! :)
